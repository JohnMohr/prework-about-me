      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi, my name is John Mohr. I'm 34, a Chef, have two cats and no kids.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from the Pacific NorthWest. Born in Oregon and moved North, and sometimes South, a number of times until I finally reached Bellingham, WA.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Snowboarding and skateboarding are my favorite hobbies. I pass the times of bad weather and sickness with video games and horticulture.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I don't honestly know anymore. Fun answer? Let me be an IT guy for a ski area and give me a lift pass to snowboard all winter. "Realistic" answer? It would be really cool to apply all the skills I've learned over the years to run my own business. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in downtown Bellingham</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>It's exciting learning the backend and how to interact with computers and the web on a greater level. To use that passion to launch a career is greatly motivating. </p>
